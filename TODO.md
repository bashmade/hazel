# TODO: Project Management Backend (Go + Gin)

## Initial Setup
- [X] Initialize Git repository
- [X] Create project structure 
- [X] Initialize Go module (`go mod init`)
- [X] Set up configuration management (`viper` or env parsing)
- [X] Create `.env` for local development
- [X] Set up Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL via Docker
- [X] Create Taskfile.yaml scripts for build and dev tasks

---

## Authentication & Authorization (JWT)
- [X] User registration
- [X] User login
- [X] Password hashing (bcrypt)
- [X] JWT generation (access token)
- [X] JWT middleware for route protection

---

## Core Models & Database Schema
- [X] User
- [X] Workspace
- [X] Project (belongs to Workspace)
- [ ] Task (belongs to Project)
- [ ] Comment (optional, belongs to Task)
- [ ] Relationships and constraints
- [X] Auto migrations (`github.com/pressly/goose`)
- [ ] Database seeding for development
